## Overview 

My project analyzes movies earnings and box office results to reach a necessary conclusion.   Microsoft needs to know that their investment in Flatiron Pictures Studios is a profitable one.   To do this, my project needs to reach several milestones and conclusions to come up with three recommendations in order for Microsoft to believe in the possibility of studio profitability.  Using open sources like IMDB, rottentomatoes, boxofficemojo a comprehensive analytical and mathematical report can and will be done.
 

## Business Problem

Microsoft is not confident in their investment in Flatiron Pictures Studio.   Or they don't know what the plan of action is and the next steps to take.   How to lead them in the right path.


## Data and Methods

Data is comprehensive from rottentomatoes, boxofficemojo, and IMDB.   Methods are used from data merging and joining, and the creation of multiple dataframes.

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for Microsoft's goals of maximizing their investments into Flatiron Movie Studios:

**Approve to make more franchise movies.** Franchise movies are one of the cornerstones to studio's success. 9 out of 10 of the highest grossing movies domestically are franchise movies. 7 out of 10 were not the first films of a franchise. Audiences come back for more. The 2nd film often outperforms the first. This is because of the general audience's innate higher expectations and the inherently effective power of franchise movies.

**Approve to make certain genres a more priority investments.** It is a good idea to make more movies in the genres of action, adventure, sci-fi and comic book movies encompass all of the all time highest grossing movies domestically. Every single one of those can be labeled among one or more of those genres.

**Approve to make extremely expensive productions.** Among the 10 most profitable movies of all time (according to the net gain bar chart), every one of the ten took at least 125 million dollars to make. They were all very costly productions.


## Final Words

With any movie that has been made, there is a possible chance of failure, but the success rate of investing in franchise movies and top genre movies are more lucrative investments than otherwise. There is a greater chance of success investing in franchise movies and genre movies of action, adventure, sci-fi, and comic book.

Also, it's entirely true that spending more to earn more is the inherent nature of big budget movie making. Just an expensive production alone isn't enough to guarantee success, but if there is not at least a minimum amount of money spent making the movie, it is unlikely to produce grandiose final box office figures or move the needle much. It's simple: with it, there's no guarantee of success but the chances are good. Without it there is no possibility of success.
